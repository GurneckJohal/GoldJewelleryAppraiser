      <h1>How the value of jewellery is appraised</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The monetary value of jewellery is approximately the value of the alloy
        that it is made of and the cost of the associated labor to produce the
        piece. When it comes to gold jewellery, the metals that are used to make
        the alloy are gold, and some other metal that the gold is mixed with for
        structural or aesthetic purposes. The greater the percentage of gold
        that is used in the alloy, the greater the "purity" of the gold. This
        purity is measured in Karats. If a piece of jewellery is made up of 24K
        gold, that means that the fraction of gold that makes up the gold alloy
        is 24/24. If a piece of jewellery is made up of 10K gold, that means
        that the fraction of gold in the gold alloy is only 10/24. In other
        words, 14/24 of the alloy used to make that piece of 10K jewellery is
        NOT gold. In the United States, the minimum fraction of Gold that is
        needed for jewellery to be classified as gold is 10K.
