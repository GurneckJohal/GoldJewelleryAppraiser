      <h1>How the cost of jewellery is calculated</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jewellery is worth the value of the alloy that is used to make it and
        the cost of the associated labor to produce it. When it comes to gold
        jewellery, the metals that make up the alloy is gold and some other
        metal that the gold is mixed with for structural or aesthetic purposes.
        The greater the percentage of gold that is used in the alloy, the
        greater the "purity" of the gold. This purity is measured in Karats. If
        the jewellery is made up of 24K gold, that means that the fraction of
        gold that makes up the gold alloy is 24/24. If the jewellery is made up
        of 10K gold, that means that the fraction of gold that makes up the gold
        alloy is only 10/24. In other words, 14/24 of the alloy used to make the
        jewellery is NOT gold. In the United States, the minimum fraction of
        Gold that is needed for jewellery to be classified as gold is 10K.
